Integration Techniques
=======================

There are many ways to integrate a function. In particular we are going to look at the following techniques:

- Substitution Rule
- Integration by Parts
- Trigonometric Integrals
- Trigonometric Substitution

$$f(x)=x^2$$

First we differentiate to get $f'(x)=2x$.
