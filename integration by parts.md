# Integration By Parts

## Formula

We are going to start with the formula for the integration by parts. What are some a few things that we notice?

$$f(x)=\int x^2 \, dx$$


## Steps 

1. Choose $u$ and $dv$
2. 


## Example 1
Integrate the following:

$$\Large{\int x \cdot e^x \, dx}$$

## How to choose

So the question is, how do we choose $u$ and $dv$ ? Well, there is not always-works-method. But there are a couple of helpful tips to remember.

- $u$ should **simplify** when differentiated
- $dv$ should be **easily integrated**

From here, a more specific rule of thumb is to remember the acronym LIATE

- **L** - logarithmic functions
- **I** - inverse trigonometric functions (technically log functions are inverse functions
- **A** - algebraic functions (think polynomials and power functions)
- **T** - trigonometric functions
- **E** - exponential functions.

## Example 2
Integrate the following:
$$\Large{\int x \cdot \sin x \, dx}$$

1. Choose $u=x$ and $dv = \sin x \, dx$
2. [[#Example 1]]
